Implement Async Loading and code-splitting to lazy-load js code that is not needed immediately. It is a performance optimization.

"While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load."

Similar to the following:
